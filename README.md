# ChatServer

 A server-client program for text messaging and Internet chatting. The server manages a number of client accounts, each having a user name and password. When a client is started, it has a menu for six functions:

0. Connect to the server
1. Get the user list
2. Send a message
3. Get my messages
4. Initiate a chat with my friend 
5. Chat with my friend

These functions allow the client to log onto the server through a TCP connection using his/her username and password, get the list of other users on the server, send a text message to another user, check his/her own text messages that were left by other users, and perform chat with another user.
